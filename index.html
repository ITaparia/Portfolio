							<h2>Web Development/Design</h2>
							<p>Web Design and Development has always been a passion of mine. Coding is the new medium of this generation, and I love to express my love for technology and coding in the form of websites. I have over 4 years of experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, in addition to serverside programming like PHP, some elements of jQuery, and others. </p>
                            <p>In terms of the actual developement process, I have gone through every single step. From brainstorming, to initial design, structuring, polishing and then eventual release. I have marketed apps too, so my experience in every step of the development process is large, and I can adapt to any situation</p>
                            <p>I work with a friend of mine and created a registered small business called TopBox Software, and together, we provide unmatched quality of webpages and applications</p>
							<p>Listed below are the applications and sites I've worked on and released. The first portion will be native apps for iOS and Android, while the second half will be actual webpages.</p>
                            <p>(Click on the app title on the cards below for links to each respective store listing)</p>

                            <h3>Don't Touch Anything</h3>
							<p>Don't Touch Anything was the first app released by my company, TopBox Software. It's an iOS-only simplistic game, with minimal controls, and allowed me to really see the development process as a whole and gave a lot of insight as to how we could better improve our workflow</p>

							<h3>Student Companion</h3>
                            <p>Student Companion was the first Productivity App released by TopBox Software, and it really gave a huge insight on the potential of app building, and what it could offer to people. Instead of just making simple games to entertain users for a little while, we know had the power to actually make a product that <i>improved</i> the lives of people. It was also the first app in which we released to both major mobile platforms: <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/student-companion/id908466788?mt=8')">iOS</span> and <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apexsoftware.studentcompanion&hl=en')">Android</span>, allowing us to realize the workflow differences of the services.</p>
							<p>Fun Fact: this app is actually ranked in the top 100 Productivity category of the Zimbabwe Google Play Store!</p>

							<h3>Lunarcy - A Moon Exploration</h3>
							<p>Lunarcy was the 3rd app officially released by TopBox Software on both <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lunarcy-a-moon-exploration/id931234602?mt=8')">iOS</span> and <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apexsoftware.Lunarcy')">Android</span>. It was more of a test than an actual productivity app, utlizing resources such as CSS animations, and other 3rd party plugins, not just vanilla HTML/CSS</p>
							<p>This was especially important in the growth of my company, since we were starting to gain knowledge that would allow us to actually create more complicated and larger apps, by improving productivity workflow.</p>

							<h3>Easy Sleep (Pending Release)</h3>
							<p>Easy Sleep is an application that was mostly developed by me, but still released under the name of TopBox Software. I decided to make this app by myself mostly because I wanted to see the entire development process experienced by a sole person, to see how indie developers without huge corporations backing them built apps. </p>
							<p>It was inspired by my, and the majority of the American teenage population having a lack of sleep. It uses the scientific basis of 90 minute sleep cycles to determine the optimal time for someone to either sleep at, or wake up.</p>

							<h2>Who am I?</h2>
							<p>Hello! I'm Ishan Taparia, and I attend William Fremd High School, in Inverness, IL. Just for a basic bio, I was born in India, and moved to Chicagoland at around 2004. Ever since then, I have lived here, and havent really moved around much.</p>
							<p>Anything computer science related has always been a passion of mine, and I was drawn most to programming because of the infinite amount of opportunities it holds. To me, coding is almost like a form of art - it's the same thing as picking up a pencil, and drawing whatever you want, and it's the same thing as picking up a camera and shooting something. Just with a few lines of code, I am given the ability to create almost anything I want, and make it available to millions around the world.</p>

							<h2>What do I do?</h2>
							<p>Since I'm a highschool student, my schedule is usually very busy, with schoolwork taking up most of my day. Obviously, in any spare time I get, I love to code. In addition to coding, something I do to just relax for a bit is play the guitar, or maybe fire up a video game to play with friends.</p>
							<p>In addition to schoolwork, I am on my school's debate team, and participate in National and State tournaments with my team. Debate Team has probably provided most of my learning experiences, and will most definitely help me in the future. In addition to debating, I also like to utilize my skills outside of the classroom through volunteering. I volunteer at the local hospital, and volunteer for an organization called CRY, which supports Children's Rights in India. Having won many volunteer outreach awards and recognitions from them, I enjoy spending time helping others when im not stuck at home doing some math homework.</p>
